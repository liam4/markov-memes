## WARNING - MAY BE NSFL ##

kind of based on that one textpost. You know the one.
 
Alternatively titled "no-one in the Jade Winglet is straight"
 
No JMP AU, so everyone is alive and at JMA. Peril is an extra student in the Jade Winglet. Extra ships: sora/carnelian, moon/kinkajou, turtle/peril
 
summary: no one in the jade winglet is straight. everyone comes out and winter lo... loathes qibli.

Winter was bored of the Academy. It was monotonous and every day seemed to drag on endlessly, especially after he released Bandit.
 
The Jade Winglet (plus the MudWing from the Gold Winglet) was supposed to be having "bonding time," but it was more than halfway into the year and everyone knew everything about everyone. At least, Winter thought he did.
 
Umber awkwardly spoke up. "So, uh... We're supposed to share. Well. I'm gay?" It sounded like a question more than a statement.
 
Carnelian let out a short bark of laughter. "Pay up, Sora. I told you! Less than a year!"
 
"Umber, couldn't you have waited for a few months?" Sora grumbled good-naturedly.
 
"Everyone knew?" Umber asked, confused. Winter sighed as everyone nodded or the likes. "Oh. Okay." Qibli then cleared his throat, gesturing to Sora and Carnelian.
 
"I see there's been a new development in the group," the SandWing stated. Sora went red and ducked her head down, while Carnelian froze. Winter furrowed his brow. The two were sitting very close to each other, but that was it. Then again, Qibli noticed it, and Qibli noticed everything. His eyes were such a beauti- disgusting shade of amber. Ew. Gross.
 
"Join the gay club," Moon laughed, bumping into Kinkajou lightly. The RainWing's scales shimmered to yellow, starting from where Moon had touched her. A grin spread over her face as Carnelian scoffed.
 
Winter shook his head. "Is no-one here straight?"
 
"I'm omnisexual," Turtle offered from the edge of the room where he sat with Peril.
 
Peril glanced over at him. "I'm bi."
 
"Qibli, your gay lord," the SandWing announced dramatically. Everyone looked at Winter.
 
Three moons. "I'm the only straight one here," the IceWing said dryly.
 
Qibli grinned, brushing his wing against Winter. Those freckles on his snout are so mesmer- messy. Messy. They're messy, Winter thought to himself as his wings tingled slightly.
 
"Are you sure about that, Prince Winter?" the SandWing asked.
 
Winter froze. What is this feeling? Is it... lo... He looked over at the smug smirk on Qibli's face. LOATHING IT'S LOATHING. WOW I ABSOLUTELY HATE QIBLI.
 
"Personal space, SandWing," Winter snapped. Qibli chuckled.
 
"No escaping it. I'm your destiny, remember? Besides, your body language all the time suggests you are, in fact, into me."
 
Winter scowled, heat rising to his face. He turned around and stormed out of the cave, trying to force the dark blue out of his face.
 
Three moons, he was in too deep.
